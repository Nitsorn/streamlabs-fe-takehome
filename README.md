## Streamlabs Frontend Take Home Assignment

Hi there! We are happy you are interested in joining the team here at Streamlabs. We as a company are on a mission of helping content creators around the world grow with our tools, and we are excited to have you on board.

We work fast, fail fast and iterate fast and keep up with the fast pace of this industry, and we are looking for a talented frontend developer to join this process with us. You will work on range of different products visible to hundreds of thousands of daily users, solve interesting non-conventional technical challenges, and grow to become full product owner along the way.

We believe it is important to design the test to match the technical challenges you will face in the company. Please carve out **maximum 4 hours** for this assignment. For that, we want you to build the basic skeleton of our popular widget - [Alertbox](https://streamlabs.com/obs-widgets/alert-box).

## Your mission

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to familiarize yourself with browser canvas API and draw a simple canvas.

- The canvas should be 100% width with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The canvas should be responsive to browser window resizing.

- The canvas should initially be drawn with 2 images, both at top-left position of the canvas. You can choose appropriate dimensions of the images but they should maintain proper aspect ratios of the original image sources.

- You should be able to **drag each image** around the canvas with your mouse cursor. An image cannot be dragged into a position where it is partially outside the canvas.

- `BONUS`: When image is in a dragged state, add a green border of 2 pixels width around that dragged image.

- Please do not use existing third party libraries such as Fabric.js.

## What we are looking for

While the hard requirements of this assignment is somewhat basic, we are looking for assignments that display deep understanding of the API and an ability to write clean, scalable and well commented code. Designing the infrastructure to easily handle new features like

- persisting state on refresh
- ability to add/remove images from file input and/or src
- reordering the z positions of each layers
- instead of drawing static images, drawing custom object (like our alerts)

## Documentation & Thought Process

- Please create SOLUTION.md documenting your learnings as you go along. You can have in a log format or in one big chunk after you finished.
